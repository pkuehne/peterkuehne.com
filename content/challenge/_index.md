I'm hoping to motivate myself to paint more in 2022 and actually keep track of all the things I'm getting done. I've compiled a list of miniatures to paint to accomplish four main targets:

1. Complete the [ASOIAF Core Box]({{< ref "/series/asoiaf-kickstarter" >}})
2. Paint the entire [Hail Caesar]({{< ref "/tags/hail-caesar" >}}): Roman Invasion of Britain starter set (2019 Christmas Present)
3. Paint the [Black Seas]({{< ref "/tags/black-seas" >}}) starter set (Another 2019 Christmas Present)
4. Paint miniatures that I acquired in 2021 (despite a vow not to buy anything new till I'm finished)

Here's the complete list that will be updated as I make progress throughout the year. You can follow updates in the [Painting Challenge 2022]({{< ref "/series/painting-challenge-2022" >}}):

* ~~20 Romans~~
