My name is Peter KÃ¼hne and I am a software engineering manager at [Bloomberg][bloomberg-careers] in London. 

I'm a programmer at heart and you'll find plenty of entries in my blog about how I set up my home network, the apps I run and the way I automate all of this via Ansible. 

My blog is also for other hobby exploits, such as painting miniatures, doing family research and reading/writing science-fiction/fantasy. 

**All views and opinions expressed are my own unless indicated otherwise.**
