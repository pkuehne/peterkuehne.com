{{< figure src="/knights-of-casterly-rock.jpg" title="Painted and based" >}}

These knights were a lot more work than I had initially anticipated. I could swear I emptied a whole pot of red paint on them! My worry was initially that they would be *too* red, but looking at them, the armour breaks up the single colour quite nicely. Plus the gold highlights add a splash of contrasting colour.

Now I just need the Mountain, his Men and Jamie Lannister and the Red Force is done!
