After getting a Community Spotlight on Beasts of War earlier this month, I thought it was high time to press pause on painting the ASOIAF backlog and to continue my efforts on this project.

To that extent, I went ahead and ordered two boxes of Warlord’s Landwehr Regiment. I’m not sure why they are marked as regiments, but for my purposes each box represents a battalion.

I also got two sets of the Prussian Jäger, which will represent the two companies of Silesian Schützen. On the whole, the Jäger and the Schützen wore very similar uniforms and I wanted to get some miniatures that had a bit more of a dynamic pose about them.

This delivery will help me cross off another two line items on my list, and hopefully I’ll be able to make some progress before my son makes his appearance in March.
