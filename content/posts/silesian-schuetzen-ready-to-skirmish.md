They’re done. And in record time as far as I’m concerned. They were an absolute pleasure to paint as well. There’s lots of variety in the poses but they still fell into three main styles, which made it a lot easier to paint.

A new highlight for my painting were the thin red pipings all along the cuffs, collars and epaulettes. That required a steady hand after a nice glass of whiskey.

That crosses another unit of my list and allows me to now go onto the first batallion of Landwehr. They’re already assembled and undercoated, so we’ll be underway this week already!
