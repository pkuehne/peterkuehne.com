{{< figure src="/all_britons.jpg" title="Ave Caesar! Morituri Te Salutant" >}}

That's the last of the Britons painted and with that the last miniature from the [Hail Caesar: Roman Invasion of Britain][starter] starter set. All in all around 125 miniatures, rivalling the number I've painted in total for my Napoleonic Prussian army. I thought it would take me much longer[^discuss], but in the end, I got into a nice rhythm, knowing exactly which colour to pick next, the order in which to paint the minis, when to include the shields, bases, etc. Not that I'm keen to paint any more Britons to be honest. I think I will let this project lie for the moment[^more].

Now that the painting is done though, I'd quite like to give the [Clash of Spears][clash] rules a go. They are meant for games of about this size, where miniatures are based individually, but can still act in cohesive formations. I honestly don't game enough with the miniatures I have and yet I keep buying rule books! I just saw that Clash of Spears has a new supplement out, which covers the imperial Roman army as well as Britons, so I guess that's a sign that I need yet another rule book...

[^discuss]: Which I've mentioned at length in [January]({{< ref january-painting-update.md >}})
[^more]: Though I do in fact have a few more Romans to paint, but more on that later...
