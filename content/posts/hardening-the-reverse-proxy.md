I came across a [blog post][tyler-post] online about how to make an nginx-based reverse proxy more secure and I went about implementing it immediately. It took me all of 30 minutes to follow the steps and get an **A** grade from [SSL Labs][ssl-labs]!

It's still going to take more to convince me that this will deter all but the most determined hackers, but it allows me to access my services when I'm not at home. With enough security in place, convenience wins out!
