Today I finished the last mini from the A Song of Ice and Fire boxset that I got from a [Kickstarter] pledge a few years ago. Brienne of Tarth valiantly led the rear-guard on the painting front and joins her fellow neutral characters to complete the Starter Set.

Alongside my pledge for the Starter Set, the pledge rewards and milestone unlocks I also bought a couple of extra boxes to round out the collection. More or less ensuring I get one box of everything[^before]. So there are five boxes left mainly with more characters, but also two more regiments of Neutral Bolton forces.

I still have more things to paint for my [2022 Challenge][challenge], but with over 78% complete by the end of February, I feel confident that I will make it by the end of the year. So I'm starting a second progress bar, which consists just of the remaining ASOIAF miniatures. Running in parallel, it'll track how I get through all that remains of my Kickstarter pledge. Pictures, are as always on my Instragram and will likely alternate with other things I still have to get through.

Below is the (automatically) updating list of minis left on the list, while the progress bar on the right will update as I complete them.

[^before]: This all happened during the time that GoT was still *good*!
