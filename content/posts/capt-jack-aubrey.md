![Capt Jack Aubrey](/capt-jack-aubrey.jpg)

Say hello to Captain [Jack Aubrey][wikipedia]! Probably most people have seen [Master and Commander][the-film] with Russel Crowe and Paul Bethany. It follows Aubrey and his crew as they fight a superior French vessel off the coast of South America. The source novel(s) were written by [Patrik O'Brian][patrick] and the good news is that after Master and Commander, there are 20 more!

The Jack Aubrey miniature was a promotional item offered by [Warlord Games][warlord] and I got it with an order of Napoleonics, I believe. The miniature is modelled after Russel Crowe, which you can't tell in my paint job, but there are some really nice versions out on the web.

Whenever I've managed to paint all my [Black Seas][black-seas] miniatures, he'll be the turn marker. Or maybe I'll see whether there is a privateer skirmish game that he would be good for. Alas, I already have far too many minis in my backlog!
