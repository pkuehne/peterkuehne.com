As Monty Python said: "And now for something completely different." While I was browsing the internet forums and blogs, I came across a post by someone trying to get his young daughter into wargaming. To do that he painted up some of her favourite characters to use in a modified skirmish game. I liked the idea and wanted to see if I could replicate his results.

So I went out searching for miniatures that could stand in for my daughter's favourite Disney heroine: Elsa from the film Frozen. I found another post on [TMP] of someone doing something very simmilar. They had found a couple of miniatures that could easily represent Elsa and her sister Anna. They were sold by [Hasslefree Miniatures][hasslefree] albeit as [Raisa] and [Cara]. They are very, very good approximations with very minor differences, mainly in the face. Raisa also shows slightly more leg than Elsa, but hey.

Painting them was very interesting. I used a lot of reference pictures off the internet and tried to mix my paints as close as possible to what was inthe pictures. I still had to take some creative license, but all the key elements are there. From Elsa's paler skin colour to the light streak in Anna's hair.

Lastly, the rules and the actual wargame itself. I bought [Song of Blades and Heroes][song] by GaneshaGames[^ganesha], which it turns out is a very nice and straight-forward set of rules. I'm still going back and forth on whether to teach my daughter [Frostgrave] instead. The rules aren't that much more difficult and I have a lot more experience with it. I still need to collect together a few more different minis anyway, like wolves and trolls, etc. So I still have a little time to decide. The first game is likely going to be very basic either way, but I'll update when we've played for the first time.

[^ganesha]: As far as I can tell, they are localed in Kharkiv in Ukraine. Given the current situation, I can only encourage you to buy the rules.
