{{< figure src="/asoiaf-box.jpg" title="What have I done?!" >}}

So a while back I backed the Kickstarter for the boardgame *A Song of Ice and Fire* by CMON Games, which is not based on the TV series *Game of Thrones*, but the original books. I thought the models looked great[^1], so I splurged and backed whatever the highest tier was that would get me all the special Kickstarter-only minis.

And now they just arrived.

I'm in trouble, I'm not going to lie. There are *loads* of minis here. Not just regiments, but also attachments, NPCs and alternative minis, like the *Mountain that rides*. I'm never going to finish painting all of them. So I had better get started. I'm opening up a new series here to track my progress in painting the various boxes that came today.

Wish me luck.
