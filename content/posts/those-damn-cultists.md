If you've been following my [twitter] feed for the past couple of weeks, you'll have seen these minis already in isolation. Now they're toegether for the first time and what a solid start to the year! With fully half of the investigators that came in the Cthulhu: Death May Die boxset already painted! They are of course lovely little miniatures. Just the right amount of detail to be fun painting, but not so much that you feel like you're never making any progress. After all, they are meant just as pawns in the actual board game.

All that's left is to varnish these guys and gals, but that will have to wait till the temperatures have picked up a bit or they'll all go dull and bubbly. It also means that I'll have to turn to painting something that I've already undercoated.
