That’s the Mountain’s Men done as well. I’ve also painted the Mountain himself, but for some bizarre reason, I made his cloak green, instead of yellow. So I will need to repaint him at some point. For now, I’m putting the brush down on this project and turning to my historicals for a bit. I’ll be back on this one with the first Stark unit.
