Lots more progress in February and if anything I've managed to increase my pace! At this point all the miniatures from the [A Song of Ice and Fire][painted] Kickstarter have been painted[^challenge].

Far more impressive though is the fact that that I have already managed to paint a whooping 50 Britons so far. With the ten I managed to complete at the tail end of January, I'm now 75% through the Britons. Only twenty more remain for March, alongside Anna & Elsa from Frozen and 9 ships.

As February has progressed so well, I've begun putting together a Phase 2, as well as adding another project to the backlog that I've been working on for a long time and might now actually get some painting done on[^prussians]! There's still plenty in the Pile of Shame, but at least now it seems to be getting smaller by the day and I plan to use the inspiration to get through as much of it as possible before I buy anything else.
